For a recent project, I had to map an environment using the **MIT-Racecar** robot in Gazebo. This is a log of my progress implementing **Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM)** on the MIT-Racecar bot. I encountered some interesting problems, and learnt a few things while solving them. In this short post, I will summarise the steps that I used to solve the problems and get `gmapping` to run on the `racecar_gazebo` simulator.

After cloning the **racecar**[^2] and **racecar_gazebo**[^3] packages to the `/src` directory and building them using `catkin_make`, I launched the simulation using:

```bash
$ roslaunch racecar-env racecar_tunnel.launch
```

Of course things never work at the first try. I encountered 2 errors which were fixed by installing the following dependencies: 

- [ackermann_msgs](http://wiki.ros.org/ackermann_msgs){: target="_blank"}

- [effort_controllers](http://wiki.ros.org/effort_controllers){: target="_blank"}

Now running the same environment launched Gazebo and spawned the racecar in the tunnel map.

To map the environment, I used gmapping. After setting up the launch file `gmapping.launch` and running it, rviz showed the warning: `No map received`. The terminal showed 

`[ WARN] [1612766930.932705394, 1106.617000000]: MessageFilter [target=odom ]: Dropped 100.00% of messages so far. Please turn the [ros.gmapping.message_filter] rosconsole logger to DEBUG for more information.`

Clearly, there was some error with the odometry information. A quick 
```bash
$ rosrun tf view_frames
``` 
revealed that the there was no `odom --> base_link` transform that is necessary for gmapping to run properly. Refer **REP 105**[^1] for the convention.

There are 2 ways of fixing this error:

1. Using the **static transform publisher**[^4], a transformation can be created from `odom --> base_link`. This will work in the case that the robot is fixed with respect to the map. But as I wanted the racecar to explore and map the environment, this approach isn't viable.
2. **Dynamically publish** the relationships between `odom` and `base_link` frame. Generally, this is done using inputs from on-board sensors like encoders and lidar to estimate the robot's location w.r.t. the map. 

Point 2 is the ideal approach. But as the robot is running in simulation, a clever shortcut can be used: Instead of using sensor readings, one can use the simulator(gazebo)'s information of the robot pose for odometry. A closer look at the `mit-racecar` code revealed that that's exactly what's being done in the `gazebo_odometry.py` script located in the `racecar_gazebo` package. 

Executing 
```bash
$ rosnode info /gazebo_odometry_node
```
revealed that this node is subscribing to the `/gazebo/link_states` topic which provides the robot pose information. It's also publishing to the `/tf` topic, which is where the `map-->odom` transform is being broadcast. This is in line with what we saw in tf tree above.  

So I made a slight modification to the `gazebo_odometry.py` to configure the tf tree for gmapping. After looking at the ROS wiki documentation for the **slam_gmapping package**[^5], I found that for gmapping to run correctly, it needs an `odom-->base_link-->laser` transform. The `gazebo_odometry.py` node was written, (from what I understood), for navigation purposes. That's why it transforms `map-->odom`, instead of `odom-->base_link`. So I simply changed the parent link to `odom` and child link to `base_link` in the script and voila! We now have working SLAM!

The `map-->odom` transform is now provided by the `/slam_gmapping` node. We can see the same by looking again at the tf tree:

Finally, I ran the `keyboard_teleop.py` script using 

```bash
$ rosrun racecar_control keyboard_teleop.py
``` 

to teleoperate the racecar. Once a good map is obtained, it can be saved using 

```bash
$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f mymap
```

With this, we come to the end of this post. The key takeaway from this post is that **TF transforms are an extremely important** part of ROS. It is vital that a ROS Developer be comfortable with interpreting the TF tree. To any beginner ROS users, I would recommend to always run `tf view_frames` node and take a look at the TF tree when implementing someone else's package.

Next I will be implementing the **ROS Navigation Stack**[^6] on the mit-racecar robot. I will post here if I encounter any interesting problems.
