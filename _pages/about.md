Hi! I’m a final-year undergraduate at [BITS Pilani, India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/){:target="\_blank"}. I am fascinated by complex dynamic systems like robots. I seek to understand these systems and control them. My interests lie in Controls, Robot Perception, and Motion Planning.

I am currently working as a research intern at the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, Carnegie Mellon University, under [Prof Howie Choset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./choset/){:target="\_blank"}. My work here includes designing gaits and controllers for Snake-Inspired Robots. 

Recently, I interned at the [Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/){:target="\_blank"}, UC San Diego, advised by [Prof Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I was part of a group that was working on a Neural Motion Planning framework for robots. In the past, I’ve had the good fortune of working closely with some wonderful researchers such as Prof. Srinivasa Prakash Regalla and Prof. Meenakshi Viswanathan. You can read more about my projects [here](/projects/).

I like to spend my free time reading Sci-Fi and Psychological Thrillers, watching mysteries, and playing FPS games.

I’m currently applying for Masters Studies in Robotics starting Fall 2022. I'm always on the lookout for meaningful opportunities and collaborations. Do get in touch if you want to discuss Robotics, Machine Learning, or your favorite novel!
