I'm a pre-final year undergraduate at [BITS Pilani, India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/){:target="\_blank"}. I am fascinated by complex dynamic systems like robots. I seek to understand these systems and control them.

I have previously worked with Mobile, Legged and Aerial robots. I have now developed a research interest in Deep Learning and Control Theory. I believe that an intersection of these disciplines has a vast potential in Robotics.

In the past, I've had the good fortune of working closely with some wonderful researchers such as [Prof. Srinivasa Prakash Regalla](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/spregalla/Profile){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Meenakshi Viswanathan](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/meenakshiviswanathan/profile){:target="\_blank"}. You can read more about my projects here.

I’m actively looking for Research opportunities in Robotics starting Fall 2021 for my final-year thesis at BITS Pilani. I am currently based in Rajkot, India but I’m open to relocate. Do get in touch with me if you’re up for a chat!
