Electric Vehicles are on the verge of becoming a mass-market product. Major car manufacturers have started electrifying their existing products. This transition creates new challenges and demands swift innovation in the development process.

It has become increasingly necessary for engineers to have a tool to assist in the selection of critical prime-mover parts like Battery and Motors. 
Such a tool can help significantly cut down design time for standard EV/HEV part specifications. Expert EV/HEV Prime-mover Selection System (EXPEVER) is an intelligent selection system for EV/HEV prime-mover parts. The software takes vehicle parameters from the user and, using a knowledge base consisting of closed-form equations, experimental data, and ML techniques, supplies key prime-mover part specifications like battery and motor specs.
