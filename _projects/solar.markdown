The recent shift to variable energy generation like wind and solar energy resources has becomea source of uncertainty in the power grid. Accurate prediction of Solar Energy generated canmitigate some of the challenges of using variable energy sources and lead to better adoption ofrenewable sources. While this problem is receiving attention from the research community,current solutions rely on time-series forecasting taking no account of the weather conditionsthat Solar Panels are operating at. This project aims to create an ANN solution for Solar Electricity Generation forecasting which solely relies on weather parameters as inputs.
