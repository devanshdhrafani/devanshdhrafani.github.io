The recent shift to variable energy generation like wind and solar energy resources has become a source of uncertainty in the power grid. Accurate prediction of Solar Energy generated can mitigate some of the challenges of using variable energy sources and lead to better adoption of renewable sources. While this problem is receiving attention from the research community, current solutions rely on time-series forecasting taking no account of the weather conditions that Solar Panels are operating at. This project aims to create an ANN solution for Solar Electricity Generation forecasting which solely relies on weather parameters as inputs.
